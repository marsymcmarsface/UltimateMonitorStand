# UltimateMonitorStand
Design files for the "Ultimate Monitor Stand"
This was designed to work with a 27" curved Samsung monitor, that is what the width was derived off of, but I have no reason to believe it wouldn't work with other sizes, within reason. HOWEVER I have not tested it with any other size, so I cannot guarentee it will work with any other monitor.

TODO:
- Parts list
- There is a slight error in the placement of fasteners in the CAD model for the joint between the base and vertical support.
- Export individual 3D printed parts.
- Probably some other stuff.
